# 📚 Library Management System

A simple **C++ project** that simulates a Library Management System. This console-based application helps manage a small library's book inventory by allowing users to add, display, search, update, and delete book records.

## 🧰 Features

- Add new book records
- Display all books
- Search books by title or author
- Update book information
- Delete books
- Menu-driven user interface
- File handling for persistent storage

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Language**: C++
- **Concepts**: File Handling, Classes & Objects, OOP
- **IDE**: Any C++-compatible IDE (e.g., Code::Blocks, VS Code)

## 📁 Project Structure

```
Library-Management-System/
│
├── Library_Management_System.cpp       # Main C++ source code
├── Library_Management_System.docx      # Project report with system description
└── README.md                           # Project overview and instructions
```

## 🚀 How to Run

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/balaji-mallepalli/Library-Management-System.git
   cd Library-Management-System
   ```

2. **Compile and run the C++ program:**
   - Using g++ in terminal:
     ```bash
     g++ library.cpp -o library
     ./library
     ```
   - Or open the file in an IDE like Code::Blocks or Dev C++ and run it there.

## 📝 Functional Overview

- **Add Book**: Insert book details and store them in a file.
- **Display Books**: Show all books stored in the system.
- **Search Book**: Find a book by title or author.
- **Update Book**: Edit existing book details.
- **Delete Book**: Remove a book record permanently.

## 📄 Documentation

- `Library_Management_System.docx` – Contains detailed explanation of the code, features, and implementation approach.

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- Add login system (admin/member roles)
- Use a database (like MySQL) instead of file handling
- Create a GUI using Qt or integrate with a web frontend

## 🙏 Acknowledgements

- Developed as a course project to demonstrate knowledge of object-oriented programming and file operations in C++.
- Thanks to our instructors and peers for their guidance and feedback.
